<div class="work info">
    <h2>Work Exprience</h2>
    <p>I have had many side jobs as an 18 years old but none of them were serious or full-time jobs.<br>
    I have worked as: 
    <ul><br>
        <li>Newspaper Delivery</li>
        <li>Supermarkt Stock Clerk</li>
        <li>Pizza Delivery</li>
    </ul><br>
    I started with delivering Newspaper to my own neighbourhood at age 13.<br>
    After that I started working in the supermarkt Albert Heijn for about a year and a half, I saved in the meantime enough money to get my scooter driver-license to be able to deliver pizza's.<br>
    After I got my license I immediately asked the Italian Pizzeria if they were in need of delivery personal, and they were. I started working from 2021 and I'm still delivering there till now.<br>
    Beside delivering there I have also learned how to make pizza's, You can't call me chef, but I can make some good pizza's!
